**Description:**

This Sankey visualization has a flow-based data API and provides end-to-end highlighting feature. It shows rich tooltips when mouseover. **[Learn more at the demo page ... ](http://qinming.github.io/sankey)**

**Compatibility:** It's originally developed for mstr Web v9.4.1. Also works fine in mstr Web v10. But is not fully tested in desktop v10.

**Usage:** Under the MicroStrategy servlet directory, go to `webapps/<app name>/plugins/`. Clone this repo. Make sure everything is in a new folder named `D3FlowHighlight`. Finally restart the tomcat server.

This visualization needs 2 or more attributes and 1 or more metrics. You can customize the default tooltip style and number formats in the "visualization properties"
