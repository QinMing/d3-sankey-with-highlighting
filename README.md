**Description:**

Compared to Mike's Sankey Plugin, this visualization has a flow-based data API and supports end-to-end highlighting feature. It shows rich tooltips when mouseover. [See the original page for detailed introduction]([2]).

**Usage:** Under the MicroStrategy servlet directory, go to `webapps/<app name>/plugins/`. Clone this repo. Make sure everything is in a new folder named `D3FlowY`. Finally restart the tomcat server.

This visualization needs 2 or more attributes and 1 or more metrics. You can customize the default tooltip style and number formats in the "visualization properties"
